# Project: Sequence

# This project contains a class that defines a sequence. This sequence is defined as a series of values of a certain datatype. The datatype can be specified by the user in the indicated area in the header file. Functions are provided, both member functions of the sequence class and nonmember functions, that perform certain operations on sequence objects, such as inserting values, erasing values, reading from input and writing to output, and more. See the documentation in the header file for a detailed description.

# This project was written using C++.
